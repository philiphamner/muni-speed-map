## 🎯 The Problem

**Light rail and streetcars are slow when they share the street with cars.**

Across the US, billions of dollars have been invested in light rail systems — yet many operate at frustratingly slow speeds because they're stuck in traffic, waiting at signals, or blocked by turning vehicles. This undermines ridership, wastes operating costs, and makes transit less competitive with driving.

The solution is known: **upgrade the right-of-way**. Move from mixed traffic → dedicated lanes → physical separation → full grade separation. But cities often lack data showing _exactly where_ trains are slowest and _why_.

## 💡 The Approach

This tool collects real-time GPS positions from transit vehicles, calculates their speeds, and visualizes the results on a map. By aggregating thousands of data points over days and weeks, patterns emerge:

- **Red zones** = Trains consistently slow down here (traffic conflicts, bad signal timing)
- **Cyan zones** = Trains move freely here (dedicated ROW, grade separation)
- **Grade crossings** = Street intersections where trains cross traffic at-grade

The goal: **Give transit advocates and planners the data they need to prioritize ROW improvements.**

## 🏙️ Why These Cities?

Each city was selected because its light rail or streetcar system has **significant street-running sections** where trains compete with traffic:

| City                  | System           | Why It's Interesting                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 🏔️ **Denver**         | RTD Light Rail   | Downtown street-running sections with at-grade crossings                                    |
| 🏔️ **Salt Lake City** | UTA TRAX         | Four light rail lines with street-running through downtown Salt Lake City                   |
| 🏗️ **Pittsburgh**     | The T Light Rail | Historic light rail system with downtown subway and South Hills surface sections            |
| 🏛️ **Sacramento**     | SacRT Light Rail | Street-running through downtown Sacramento with Gold and Blue Lines                         |
| 🦀 **Baltimore**       | MTA Light Rail   | 29-mile light rail with branches to BWI Airport, Glen Burnie, and Hunt Valley               |

**Not included:** Heavy rail systems (BART, NYC Subway, DC Metro) that are fully grade-separated — they don't have traffic conflicts to analyze.

### 🔮 Potential Future Cities

These systems have significant street-running and could be added:

| City             | System      | Why It's a Good Candidate                                                      |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🌊 **San Diego** | MTS Trolley | Large network with street-running sections through downtown and East County    |
| 🤠 **Houston**   | METRORail   | Red Line runs at-grade through Midtown and Medical Center                      |
| 🇨🇦 **Calgary**   | CTrain      | One of North America's busiest light rail systems with downtown street-running |
| 🇨🇦 **Edmonton**  | ETS LRT     | Capital, Metro, and Valley Lines with urban at-grade sections                  |

### ❌ Systems We Chose Not to Include

| System                                   | Why Not                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BART** (SF Bay Area)                   | Fully grade-separated heavy rail — no traffic conflicts to analyze                      |
| **NYC Subway**                           | Underground/elevated heavy rail — speed issues are scheduling, not traffic              |
| **DC Metro**                             | Fully grade-separated — no street-running sections                                      |
| **Chicago L**                            | Elevated/subway heavy rail — traffic conflicts not a factor                             |
| **Caltrain / Metrolink / Commuter Rail** | Mostly dedicated ROW with rural crossings — different problem than urban street-running |

The focus remains on **light rail and streetcars that compete with street traffic** — where ROW improvements can make the biggest difference.

## 📊 Data Collection

### How Speed is Calculated

- **SF, Seattle, San Diego, Philadelphia**: Speed calculated from GPS distance ÷ time between consecutive readings (~90 seconds apart)
- **LA, Boston, Portland, Toronto, Sacramento**: Speed reported directly by the transit agency's API

## 🔄 Updating GTFS Data

If transit routes change, refresh the static data:

```bash
# 1. Download fresh GTFS data to gtfs_cityname/
# 2. Re-run parsers
npm run parse-gtfs:sf
npm run parse-stops:sf
npm run fetch-crossings
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Transit Advocacy

- Identify slow zones caused by traffic conflicts
- Support arguments for transit priority signals
- Compare street-running vs. grade-separated performance

### Planning & Analysis

- Understand real-world operating speeds vs. scheduled
- Identify patterns by time of day (future feature)
- Compare performance across cities
