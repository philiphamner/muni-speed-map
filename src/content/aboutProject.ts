  overview: {
    intro: [
      "As a Bay Area native and huge railfan, I've always loved riding San Francisco's Muni light rail. But I've also been frustrated by how slow it often feels, and I couldn't find any granular data showing where and why trains bog down. So I built this using SFMTA's live vehicle feed as the source, then aggregating repeated observations into a speed map. Once I had a working prototype, I realized the same approach could apply to other cities.",
      "I chose to focus on light rail specifically because it operates in environments where targeted improvements like signal priority, stop consolidation, and lane separation can make a real difference. Light rail in North America often suffers from operating in mixed traffic, signal delays, frequent stops, and constrained infrastructure. By combining fleet-wide observation snapshots with static GTFS and infrastructure overlays, this platform makes it possible to identify systemic slow zones, compare cities, and evaluate infrastructure tradeoffs.",
    ],
    goal: 'The aim is to turn anecdotal complaints about "slow trains" into measurable, actionable insights.',

      "An aggregated snapshot of train speed and location observations collected from repeated weekday sampling sessions in February 2026. This is not live train tracking.",
    dataCollectionTitle: "How the Speed Maps Were Built",
    dataCollection:
      "To capture the train speed data, I queried each transit agency's live vehicle endpoint every 90 seconds over several hours across multiple weekdays in February 2026. Each query returned the latest reported location and speed for the agency's entire active light rail fleet, not just a single train. I collected those system-wide snapshots and aggregated them into a city-level speed map showing where trains tend to move quickly or slow down.",

    sources: [

      "Geographic units are Census tracts, which are small statistical subdivisions that typically contain 1,200 to 8,000 people (averaging around 4,000). Both the US and Canadian census systems use similarly sized tracts, so granularity is consistent across all cities.",

      "Coverage includes all cities in the platform, with county-level or CMA-level coverage listed in each city's sidebar.",

      "Route lines are divided into fixed 200-meter segments. Each vehicle position is assigned to the segment it falls within based on distance along the route.",
      "For some cities (currently Los Angeles and Denver), the platform combines speed readings from both directions of travel into unified segment averages. Instead of splitting readings between parallel tracks, all readings contribute to one average per segment, which produces more statistically robust data.",
      "The result is a speed profile that answers 'how fast do trains move through this section' rather than tracking inbound vs outbound separately.",
    ],
    lineStatistics: [
      "The 'Speed by Line' statistics exclude vehicles traveling below 0.5 mph to focus on operational speeds.",
      "This filtering removes trains stopped in yards and maintenance facilities, which would artificially lower averages without reflecting actual in-service performance.",

  {
    city: "Baltimore",
    note: "Light RailLink shows gaps in coverage along certain stretches, especially between stations, possibly due to limited GPS reporting frequency or infrastructure constraints. Regional context includes Metro SubwayLink and MARC commuter rail. Speed is calculated from GPS positions by measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (about 90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "Boston",
    note: "Green Line branch merges and street-running sections create strong speed variation by branch and by central subway approach. Each branch has distinct operating characteristics worth comparing separately. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API for each vehicle observation.",
  },
  {
    city: "Charlotte",
    note: "LYNX Blue and Gold lines have distinct service patterns. Compare overlap areas separately from end segments for clearer speed interpretation, as shared trackage can show different performance than single-line sections. Speed is calculated from GPS positions by measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (about 90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "Cleveland",
    note: "RTA corridor behavior varies between shared trunk sections and outer branches. Line-level filtering is useful before comparing averages, as the Red Line operates differently from the Blue and Green lines. Speed is calculated from GPS positions by measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (about 90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "Denver",
    note: "RTD operates multiple long corridors with different operating profiles. Only light rail lines are included; commuter rail lines (A, B, G, N) are excluded. Network-wide averages can hide major segment-level differences between suburban and urban sections, so line-level filtering is useful. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API for each vehicle observation.",
  },
  {
    city: "Los Angeles",
    note: "Complex areas around major terminals can look choppy because GTFS shape granularity varies by operator. Regional context includes Metrolink commuter rail. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API for each vehicle observation.",
  },
  {
    city: "Minneapolis-St. Paul",
    note: "Airport tunnel and grade-separated sections show distinct speed behavior compared with downtown street-running areas. The Blue and Green lines share downtown trackage, so comparing individual line performance separately from the shared core is useful. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API for each vehicle observation.",
  },
  {
    city: "Philadelphia",
    note: "Street-running trolley segments often lack OSM grade-crossing tags, so mixed-traffic behavior is interpreted primarily from speed patterns. Regional context includes SEPTA Regional Rail, SEPTA subway lines, PATCO, and NJ Transit Atlantic City Line. Speed is calculated from GPS positions by measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (about 90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "Phoenix",
    note: "Valley Metro is largely surface-running with extensive at-grade segments. Intersection effects and corridor traffic conditions are often visible in the speed distribution, making this a good example of mixed-traffic light rail performance. Speed is calculated from GPS positions by measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (about 90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "Pittsburgh",
    note: "The T transitions between a downtown subway and South Hills surface running, creating clear speed differences between tunneled and at-grade sections. GPS positions from the source data appear somewhat offset from the track alignment, possibly due to older onboard equipment. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API for each vehicle observation.",
  },
  {
    city: "Portland",

    city: "Salt Lake City",
    note: "TRAX lines share downtown trackage, so comparing individual line speeds separately from the shared core gives clearer results. The system includes both street-running and grade-separated segments with distinct performance characteristics. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API for each vehicle observation.",

    city: "San Diego",
    note: "The Trolley system covers four lines with varying service patterns across the metro area. Regional context includes NCTD Coaster commuter rail. The system includes both street-running and grade-separated segments. Speed is calculated from GPS positions by measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (about 90 seconds apart).",

  {
    city: "San Francisco",
    note: "N Judah tunnel speeds may appear clustered at portals due to limited GPS signal in the Sunset Tunnel. The F-Market & Wharves line is hidden by default to avoid confusing its slower street-running speeds with the faster underground Muni Metro lines. Speed is calculated from GPS positions by measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (about 90 seconds apart).",

  {
    city: "San Jose",
    note: "Regional context includes Bay Area commuter and metro lines (BART, Caltrain, Capitol Corridor) visible when zoomed out. VTA light rail operates primarily at surface level with significant at-grade segments. Speed is calculated from GPS positions by measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (about 90 seconds apart).",
