  overview: {
    intro: [
      "As a Bay Area native and huge railfan, I've always loved riding San Francisco's Muni light rail. But I've also been frustrated by how slow it often feels, and I couldn't find any granular data showing where and why trains bog down. So I built it myself, leveraging SFMTA's live location data to map train speeds in real time. Once I had a working prototype, I realized the same approach could apply to other cities.",
      "I chose to focus on light rail specifically because, unlike heavy metro systems or commuter/regional rail, it operates in environments where targeted improvements (signal priority, stop consolidation, lane separation) can make a real difference. Light rail in North America often suffers from operating in mixed traffic, signal delays, frequent stops, and constrained infrastructure. By combining real-time data with static GTFS and infrastructure overlays, this platform makes it possible to identify systemic slow zones, compare cities, and evaluate infrastructure tradeoffs.",
    ],
    goal: 'The aim is to turn anecdotal complaints about "slow trains" into measurable, actionable insights.',

    segmentAverages: [
      "Route lines are divided into fixed 200-meter segments. Each vehicle position is assigned to the segment it falls within based on distance along the route.",
      "For some cities (currently Los Angeles and Denver), the platform combines speed readings from both directions of travel into unified segment averages. This produces more statistically robust data—instead of splitting readings between parallel tracks, all readings contribute to one average per segment.",
      "The result is a speed profile that answers 'how fast do trains move through this section' rather than tracking inbound vs outbound separately.",
    ],
    lineStatistics: [
      "The 'Speed by Line' statistics exclude vehicles traveling below 0.5 mph to focus on operational speeds.",
      "This filtering removes trains stopped in yards and maintenance facilities, which would artificially lower averages without providing meaningful insight into in-service performance.",
      "While this approach may exclude some trains legitimately stopped at stations during passenger loading, it provides a more accurate picture of how fast trains move when actually in motion on the network.",

  {
    city: "Baltimore",
    note: "Light RailLink shows gaps in coverage along certain stretches, especially between stations, possibly due to limited GPS reporting frequency or infrastructure constraints. Regional context includes Metro SubwayLink and MARC commuter rail. Speed is calculated from GPS positions, measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (~90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "Boston",
    note: "Green Line branch merges and street-running sections create strong speed variation by branch and by central subway approach. Each branch has distinct operating characteristics worth comparing separately. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API, giving accurate real-time readings.",
  },
  {
    city: "Charlotte",
    note: "LYNX Blue and Gold lines have distinct service patterns. Compare overlap areas separately from end segments for clearer speed interpretation, as shared trackage can show different performance than single-line sections. Speed is calculated from GPS positions, measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (~90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "Cleveland",
    note: "RTA corridor behavior varies between shared trunk sections and outer branches. Line-level filtering is useful before comparing averages, as the Red Line operates differently from the Blue and Green lines. Speed is calculated from GPS positions, measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (~90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "Denver",
    note: "RTD operates multiple long corridors with different operating profiles. Network-wide averages can hide major segment-level differences between suburban and urban sections, so line-level filtering is useful for interpretation. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API, giving accurate real-time readings.",
  },
  {
    city: "Los Angeles",
    note: "Complex areas around major terminals can look choppy because GTFS shape granularity varies by operator. Regional context includes Metrolink commuter rail. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API, giving accurate real-time readings.",
  },
  {
    city: "Minneapolis–St. Paul",
    note: "Airport tunnel and grade-separation sections show distinct speed behavior compared with downtown street-running areas. The Blue and Green lines share downtown trackage, so compare individual line performance separately from the shared core. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API, giving accurate real-time readings.",
  },
  {
    city: "Philadelphia",
    note: "Street-running trolley segments often lack OSM grade-crossing tags, so mixed-traffic behavior is interpreted primarily from speed patterns. Regional context includes SEPTA Regional Rail, SEPTA subway lines, PATCO, and NJ Transit Atlantic City Line. Speed is calculated from GPS positions, measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (~90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "Phoenix",
    note: "Valley Metro is largely surface-running with extensive at-grade segments. Intersection effects and corridor traffic conditions are often visible in the speed distribution, making this a good example of mixed-traffic light rail performance. Speed is calculated from GPS positions, measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (~90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "Pittsburgh",
    note: "The T transitions between downtown subway and South Hills surface running, creating clear grade-separation and speed regime differences in one corridor. This makes Pittsburgh useful for comparing tunnel vs surface performance. GPS positions derived from the source data appear somewhat offset from the track alignment. I am unsure why, perhaps because of old technology used by the city. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API, giving accurate real-time readings.",
  },
  {
    city: "Portland",
    note: "MAX uses downtown transit-mall segments where trains share lanes with buses. Grade-crossing patterns may appear sparse in the core because these differ from conventional at-grade crossings. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API, giving accurate real-time readings.",
  },
  {
    city: "Salt Lake City",
    note: "TRAX lines share downtown trackage, so compare individual line speeds separately from the shared core for clearer interpretation. The system includes both street-running and grade-separated segments with distinct performance characteristics. Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API, giving accurate real-time readings.",

  {
    city: "San Diego",
    note: "The Trolley system covers four lines with varying service patterns across the metro area. Regional context includes NCTD Coaster commuter rail. The system includes both street-running and grade-separated segments. Speed is calculated from GPS positions, measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (~90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "San Francisco",
    note: "N Judah tunnel speeds may appear clustered at portals due to limited GPS signal in the Sunset Tunnel. The F-Market & Wharves line is hidden by default to avoid confusing its slower street-running speeds with the faster underground Muni Metro lines. Speed is calculated from GPS positions, measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (~90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "San Jose",
    note: "Regional context includes Bay Area commuter and metro lines (BART, Caltrain, Capitol Corridor) visible when zoomed out across the broader metro footprint. VTA light rail operates primarily in surface-running configurations with significant at-grade segments. Speed is calculated from GPS positions, measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (~90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "Seattle",
    note: "Link transitions between tunneled and surface-running segments, so speed patterns can shift quickly at transition points and around major interline sections. Speed is calculated from GPS positions, measuring distance traveled between consecutive readings (~90 seconds apart).",
  },
  {
    city: "Toronto",
    note: "Streetcar corridors run in mixed traffic and typically are not tagged as classic railway grade crossings in OSM, so infrastructure markers may appear sparse. Context layers include TTC subway (heavy rail) and GO Transit (commuter rail). Speed is provided directly by the transit agency's API, giving accurate real-time readings.",
